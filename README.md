# MERN Stack Kanban Board

A **full-stack Kanban board application** built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to manage tasks and workflows efficiently. This project implements both frontend and backend services, featuring authentication, task management, and drag-and-drop functionality.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

The project is structured into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

### **Backend** (`/backend`)
The backend is a Node.js application using Express to manage API routes and services.

#### **Details**
- **`config/`**: Contains all configuration-related files like database connections and environment variables.
- **`controllers/`**: Houses the controller logic for handling API routes.
- **`errors/`**: Includes custom error classes and error-handling utilities.
- **`middleware/`**: Contains Express middleware for tasks like authentication and logging.
- **`models/`**: Defines database structure using Mongoose schemas and models.
- **`routes/`**: API route definitions linking endpoints to their controllers.
- **`services/`**: Houses the business logic and reusable service functions.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers for common tasks.
- **`app.ts`**: Configures the Express application, adding middleware and routes.
- **`index.ts`**: The entry point of the backend server, responsible for starting the application.

### **Frontend** (`/frontend`)
The frontend is a React application built with TypeScript and styled using Material-UI. It includes Redux for both local and server states management and utilizes hooks for reusability.

#### **Details**
- **`assets/`**: Contains static files such as images and fonts used in the application.
- **`components/`**: Houses reusable React components like buttons, modals, and form elements.
- **`contexts/`**: Contains React Contexts for managing global state, such as authentication context.
- **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for reusable logic (e.g., API calls, event listeners).
- **`pages/`**: Contains full-page components like Login, Dashboard, and other main views.
- **`redux/`**: Manages application state with Redux Toolkit (e.g., slices, store).
- **`themes/`**: Stores Material-UI theme configurations for consistent styling across the app.
- **`types/`**: Includes TypeScript type definitions for strong typing in the app.
- **`utils/`**: Helper functions for tasks such as API requests, validations, etc.
- **`App.tsx`**: Main React application component containing routing logic.
- **`main.tsx`**: The entry point for the React application, rendering the app into the DOM.
- **`vite-env.d.ts`**: Vite-specific environment type definitions.
